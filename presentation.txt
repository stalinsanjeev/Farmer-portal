Neha rao : 

	we have 3 data bases :

				1.register

					We have user information in register 

				2.products 

					We have product id and price in products which 						will help us in placing orders and reduce 						redundancy so we don't have to type again
				3.orders

					in orders table we collect information from the 
					products and register table using name and pid
					these orders table will be sent to admin to 						deliver products
		we used mysql database and Xampp server 

Sanjeev:

	registration:
			when we register it will lead us into register.java file and here
			we create a class called member to store all values of 					registration, we create a member object and pass it into the 	
			registerdao.java file ,there it will access the database and 
			enter values into register table.
			if successful it will lead us to registration success page if not 
			it will lead us to error page

	login :
		when we login ,it will lead us into login.java file which will collect 			details and send us into logindao.java file where validation happens from 
		Register table  and gives us acmes to homepage.jsp

		1.medicines :

	--ordering--


      {	ordercrocin.jsp-->order validation (order.java-->orderdao.java)-->success.jsp }

		so lets order Crocin ,if we click on order it will take us into 			ordericrocin.jsp where we can see the details of the product and the 			price ,we have to give our username ,the quantity we have to purchase and 		the shipping address.

		the order validation will take place in order.java and orderdao.java where
		it will take the details and insert it into the table using sql queries.
